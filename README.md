Make a program that will receive the permittivity, permeability and conductivity of a material and answers:
* The material classification as conductor, dielectric or almost conductor as a function of its frequency in a graphical format. [OK]
* The graphic for the atenuation factor and the phashe factor in function of the frequency.
* Make the same for the medium impedance, the propagation speed, the group speed, the shifting speed and the medium dispersion.
* Test those programs with relevant data for freshwater, salty water, air and concrete (search for those permeabilities, permittivities and conductivities). Use the results for alanising those materials.
* With the above data, show in graphs the penetration of waves from 10 kHz to 100 GHz in those material; in this item consider that the penetration is the wave's traveled distance till the field be reduced to 0.707 of its initial value.
